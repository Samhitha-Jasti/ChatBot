Algorithm has deep learning network(Feet forward neural network).

Tokenization- Splitting a string into meaningful units.
(Punctuation characters works different for every tokenization technique)

Stemming(Porter Stemer Algorithm)- A NLP techniques, generates the root form of the words.
Crude heuristic that chops of the ends off of words.

PreProcessing Pipeline---
Tokenize->Lower+Stem->Excluding Punctuation characters->Bag of words
